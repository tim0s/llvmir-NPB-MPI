This version of the NAS Parallel Benchmarks has been patched in order to
generate LLVM IR bitcode instead of regular executables.

This requires LLVM, GCC and dragonegg.

You might want to adjust the path to the dragonegg plugin and your MPI header
files in config/make.def.

To just have a quick look at the IR, check out the bin directory, it contains
some pregenerated "binaries".
